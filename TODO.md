  - `retry_after_ms` when rate-limited
  - Direct chats category
  - On sync, check messages API, if a limited sync timeline was received

  - Make links in room subtitle clickable, formatting?
  - `<pre>` scrollbar on overflow

  - When inviting someone to direct chat, room is "Empty room" until accepted,
    it should be the peer's display name instead.

  - See `Qt.callLater()` potential usages
  - Banner name color instead of bold
  - Animate RoomEventDelegate DayBreak apparition
